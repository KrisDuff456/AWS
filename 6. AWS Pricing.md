# AWS Pricing
This documentation is off my own notes and experiances with Amazon Web service.  AWS uses a pay as you go for most if not all 
thier cloud services. The service is similar to how you pay for your utilities such as Gas and electricity and once you stop using them 
there are no additional costs or termination fees. 

Head on over to the AWS site to get more infromation on the individual prices for each services : https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/?nc2=h_ql_pr

# Calculate Your Savings
AWS has two options for saving costs:
	
- Simple Monthly Calculator
	
	You can use this calculator weather or not you are running one or multiple services, you can estimate 
	your monthly bill or estimate a specific service. 
	

- TCO Calculator
	
	AWS TCO calculator gives you the option to evaluate your savings from usng AWS and comparing against on premises and location
	environments. This tool takes into consideration all your costs to run a solution providing a more realistic comparison of your
	costs. 
	
# EC2 Instances Pricing 
There are four ways to pay for EC2 isntances: 

- On-Demand
	
	On-Demand instances, you pay for compute capacity by per hour or per second depending on the type of instance i.e. t2.micro
	There is no long term commitments or upfront payments needed/ You can increase or decrease your compute capacity based off the
	application.
	On-Demand is recommended for: 
	
	* Users that perfer low costs and felxibility
	
	* Application with short-term workloads 
	
	* Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the frist time
	
- Spot Instances

	Spot Instances allow you to request spare EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price. AWS Spot Instances are
	recommended for:
	
	* Applications that have flexible start and end times
	
	* Application that are only feasible at low costs
	
	* Users with urgent needs for large amount of additional capacity
