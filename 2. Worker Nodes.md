# Worker Nodes
This guide will look at how to create and join the workers nodes to your cluster. I will be using a cloudformation template to create the node groups.

The cloudformation script you can find here : 
  https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/2018-11-07/amazon-eks-nodegroup.yaml
Save the file or simple use the link in the create stack template

# Step 1 
On the AWS console head on over to the cloudformation dashboard you should see a list of your previous stacks created.
  - Click on create stack
  - Either upload the choosen template or use the Amazon S3 template URL
  - Follow the on screen instructions and enter the suitable names
  - For the Cluster name enter the exact name of your cluster
  - Choose your created secruity group
  - Enter the instance type you wish 
  - Give your key a suitable name this will be used to SSH onto the worker nodes if you dont have one you can create one on the EC2   
    dashboard.
  
Once you have finished filling in the requirements click next to review and then create. Once created head over to the cloudfomration dashbord and go into the worker stack to find the NodeInstanceRole. 

# Step 2 
You will first need to have AWS CLI installed and to download the config-map either using the cURL command or from the AWS site:

AWS - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html

command - curl -O https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/2019-02-11/aws-auth-cm.yaml 

Once you have downloaded the yaml file open it up using a text editor and replace the rolearn with your own recorded NodeInstanceRole so it should be something like: 

                      mapRoles: |
                         - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::11110023333:role/doc-tet-worker-nodes-NodeInstanceRole
                           username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
                           groups:
                                - system:bootstrappers
                                - system:nodes
                                
# Step 3
You will need to have kubectl installed onto your system to follow this next step:
  - In your commmand line type :
  - kubectl apply -f aws-auth-cm.yaml
  
This will apply the config map to your cluster and allow the worker nodes to join the cluster so when we do the following commands from now on you should be able to interact with the ndoes: 
  - kubectl get nodes
