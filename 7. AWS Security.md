# AWS Identity & Access Managment
A Service within AWS which enables you to manage your resources and AWS services more securely. Using this service you can create and manage users and groups by controlling the amount of permissions either one can have. Through the use of permissions you can allow or deny access to a resource or limit the control a user/group will have. 

The service has no additional charge and is a pay for what you use policy. 

- AWS Resources
IAM enables your user to control access to AWS services and you can specifiy the resource you wont controlled. You can also set up specfic conditions in order for the user to have access or control to a service. 

- Multi-factor Authentication
Enabling the AWS MFA service will add another layer of security at no extra cost, this service augments your user name and password credentials. Using this service will require the user to authenticate themselves to login, either by a MFA token or using MFA code which will require the use of a mobile. 

- Mobile and Browser
Control what mobile applications or broswers have access to a AWS resource by requesting temporary security credentials. These credentials will grant specific access to AWS resources for a particular period of time.

# How to use IAM
You can access IAM through your Managment Console, from thier you can create and assign users to have individual secruity credentials and enable the MFA. You can also look and see which permissions a user can have attached to them. 

Creating a role and managing the permissions which it will be responsible so that users can assume that role. You can also control who can  assume this role. 

A limit of 10 permissions can be applied to a user so allocating a role or group with diffrent sets of permissions can help.
