# EKS creation
This guide will foucs on creating an EKS cluster with 4 subnets 2 public and 2 private, VPC, Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway. Using a CloudFormation template will make it easier and quicker to set up the infrastructure on AWS. 

# CloudFomration
AWS allows you to quickly deploy resources and applciations in AWS, there are multiple templates available on thier site. You can also create your own templates using the AWS Template designer. I will be using a template which will create 4 subnets, VPC, Security Group, Route Table and Internet Gateways. 

# Step 1
If not already create an account on aws and a user check your region at the top right hand corner and set it to your prefrence I will be using Ireland to create the EKS. Then head to the AWS Managment console and look into the Cloudformation feature. 
  - Choose create stack 
  - Upload a template to the Amazon S3 and choose upload
  - The template I will be using is available in the Yamls folder
  - Follow the on-screen instructions 
  - You can choose to tag your resources if you wish
  - Once on the Review page click create and AWS will follow the template and create the resoruces specified
  - This may take a few minutes for AWS to configure and create the infrastructure, AWS will let you know when the resources are created.

# Step 2 
This next step will be to make two of the subnets private, first we need to go into the VPC Dashboard and there we will create to Elastic IPs. 
  - On the left hand side click the Elastic IPS tab
  - Click on the ALlocate new address
  - follow the on-screen instructions 
  - You will need to create two of these for the subnets and take note of thier Allocation ID 

*NAT gateways are required for your private subnets to enable instances within a private subnet to have access to the internet or other AWS services. 
We will use our IPs to create two NAT Gateways for our private subnets: 
  - On the left hand side click the NAT Gateways tab and click create NAT Gateway
  - Make sure to take note of the subnets and allocation IDs
  - Follow the on-screen instructions and create two NAT gateways. 
  
While that is being done head to the Route table tab and create a new table for the NAT Gateways:
  - Follow the onscreen instructions to create a private route table
  - Click the created route table and see the tabs below 
  - Edit the routes and add in a new destination called 0.0.0.0/0 with a NAT Gateway target for your own Gateway created
  - Create another route table for the second NAT Gateway repeat
  - Look at your subnets You will have two in each availability zone
  - Take one subnet from each zone and edit thier route table to the one you've created previously.
It is important to keep a note of your subnets and there availability zone, each zone should end with one public and one private subnet to ensure the private subnets can communicate.
