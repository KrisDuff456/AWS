# EFS & Persistent  Volume
This guide will look at how to create an Elastic File System in AWS which will provide a cloud storage system for your EC2 Instances. The good thing about an EFS is that you only pay for what you put in and will grow and shrink automatically based on youtr files you put into the system. 

You will need to have a VPC and EC2 instances up and running in order for the EFS to be mounted to your EC2 instances first before creating EFS.

# EFS
You can easily create an EFS by going into the Amazon managment console and head to the EFS dashboard: 
  - Click get started 
  - Select your VPC 
  - AWS reccomends you create a mount target for both availability zones so that instances across your VPC network can accesss the file system. This is good practise to have for the worst case if one of your avilability zones goes down you will have the other zone to pick up the slack. 
  - Click on Next
  - You can your set of tags to the EFS
  - CLick Next
  - Review your EFS and click create File System

This set-up will take some time in order for the mount targets to be created and connected to your subnets. 

# Persistent  Volume 
My experiance in using EFS has been with Terraform and kubernetes, you can look at my Terraform to see how I created an EFS and mounted target in the scripts. 

Using the efs-persistent.yaml file you can set up a presistent volume claim: 
      https://github.com/banzaicloud/banzai-charts/blob/master/efs-provisioner/efs-provisioner.yaml
Download the file and open the file in your text editor to start making the changes needed for your persistent volume: 
  - under ConfigMap make the changes under data
  - {file system Id} 
  - {AWS Region}
  - example.com/aws-efs
If you are using a dns name then you can add that under data as "dns.name" and insert your dns address for the EFS
  - move down to deployment and make changes to volumes
  - Under nfs replace the infromation there with your efs dns address
  - once done move under the storageClass
  - replace the provisioner information with your EFS name which you created eariler.

The next steps will involve addding the required permissions to your account.
  - In ClusterRoleBinding under subjects 
  - Replace the namespace value
  - You will then need to add the following below
  
                        kind: Role
                        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
                        metadata:
                          name: leader-locking-efs-provisioner
                        rules:
                          - apiGroups: [""]
                            resources: ["endpoints"]
                            verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch"]
                        ---
                        kind: RoleBinding
                        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
                        metadata:
                          name: leader-locking-efs-provisioner
                        subjects:
                          - kind: ServiceAccount
                            name: default
                            # replace with namespace where provisioner is deployed
                            namespace: default
                        roleRef:
                          kind: Role
                          name: leader-locking-efs-provisioner
                          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

  - Same again replace the namespace with your own
  - If you made changes to the storage class "efs-aws" change it so that it is the same as the changes if not leave it.
  - save the file

Now you will need to apply the file you've saved to your kubernetes by using the following commands: 
  - kubectl apply -f provisoner-manifest.yaml
  - run "kubectl get deploy" will display your efs provisioner deployment
  - run "kubectl get pvc" will display the persistent volume claim
