# ECR
This guide will look at how to create an Elastic Container Registry on AWS and use it to store, manage and deploy container images my experiance in using this was mainly in Docker. 

# Prerequiste
You will need to have the up-to date version of AWS CLI and have docker installed. As mention before you can use aws cli to configure your user using "aws configure" You should also be using Ubuntu for this process by installing VirtualBox onto your system. 

# Step 1 
Head on over to AWS ECR dashboard on yoru managment console assuming you are an admin for your account then you will already have sufficient permissions. If your a user on the account then head over to IAM user first.

# IAM User
You will need to make sure your user has permissions to access the Amazon ECR service.

# ECR Creation
Head over to the ECR dashboard and then press Get started

 - Type in the name of your ecr
 - press create 
 
 If your using the aws cli to create a ECR you can follow them below: 
 - aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <your repository name>

# Step 2 
If your wanting to push a Docker image to your repository you can follow this example below, this is just a simple google sample image: 
  - First Pull the image 
  - docker pull gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0

Make a note of the "repositoryUri" value displayed after you've ran the command
  - Tag the image with the "repositoryUri" from the previous step:
  - docker tag gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0 <repositoryUri>
  
*Note: you can find your aws_Account_id by navigating to "Support" in the AWS console, you should see your account number displayed

  - Get the docker login authentication command string for your registry:
  - aws ecr get-login --no-include-email
  - Copy and run the displayed command.
  - Push the image to the ECR repository
  - docker push <repositoryUri>
  
 When you go to your ECR on AWS you should see the container image stored.
